    <H1>Welcome to ... From the Core!<H1>
    <p>The MSVC Core Services team is part of the Nexus team in IP Development. In order to understand MSVC Core Services, it is important to understand the meaning of a "service".  Cerner defines "service" as a name registered with the message bus that uniquely identifies a unit capable of processing requests. Typically, one service can process one or more requests. A service should not be confused with a server. Services are abstract in the sense that they specify a logical unit of work regardless of where the work is actually performed. Servers are the physical entities that implement the logical unit of work associated with a service. <p>
